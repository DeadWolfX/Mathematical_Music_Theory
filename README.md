<h2>Project description</h2>
<p>This project contains a Jupyter Lab notebook resulting from personal developments in musical mathematical theory, 
which allows for the musicalization of sequences of digits based on the assignment of numerical notes with a cyclic group, ie, $\text{Music_Notes}\cong Z_{12}$.</p>
